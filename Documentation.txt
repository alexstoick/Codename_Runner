**MonsterVector:
	- holds all the targetable objects ( enemy airplane, monsters, sentries )
	- has 3 vectors: monsters (names), transforms (transforms), angles (holds the angle with which they were spawned.
	- has static functions for adding/retrieving information about its vectors.

** SpawnOnLoft:
	- exists on all new objects that are spawned and it is the one that controls that the objects are spawned exactly on the loft.
	- when an object is added to the loft they are given a random rotation which is important for some objects (sentry gun)
	- also triggers their addition to the MonsterVector class.
